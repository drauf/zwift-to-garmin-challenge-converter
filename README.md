# ðŸš´ Zwift to Garmin challenge converter

**Make your Zwift rides count for Garmin badges and challenges!**

## The problem

Zwift activities are tagged as coming from "Zwift" rather than a Garmin device, so they **don't count** towards Garmin Connect badges, challenges, or monthly goals.

## The solution

This tool modifies Zwift FIT files to appear as if they came from a **Garmin Edge 840**:
- âœ… Activities count for Garmin badges and challenges
- âœ… All ride data preserved (power, heart rate, cadence, etc.)
- âœ… Creates new files with `_edge840` suffix (originals untouched)

## Usage

### Build:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Convert files:
```bash
# Single file
java -jar target/zwift-to-garmin-converter.jar "My Zwift Ride.fit"

# Entire directory
java -jar target/zwift-to-garmin-converter.jar /path/to/zwift/activities

# Verbose output
java -jar target/zwift-to-garmin-converter.jar -v "My Zwift Ride.fit"
```

**Manually upload the `*_edge840.fit` files to Garmin Connect.**

## Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
