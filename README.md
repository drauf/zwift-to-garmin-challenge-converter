# 🚴 Zwift to Garmin Challenge Converter

**Make your Zwift rides count for Garmin badges and challenges!**

## 🎯 The Problem

When you complete virtual rides on Zwift, the activities are tagged as coming from "Zwift" rather than a Garmin device. This means they **don't count** towards:
- Garmin Connect badges and challenges
- Monthly distance/time goals
- Garmin device-specific achievements

Even if you use a Garmin watch or bike computer during your Zwift session, the uploaded FIT file is marked as a Zwift activity.

## 💡 The Solution

This tool modifies Zwift FIT files to make them appear as if they came from a **Garmin Edge 840**. After modification:
- ✅ Activities count for Garmin badges and challenges
- ✅ All your ride data is preserved (power, heart rate, cadence, etc.)
- ✅ Zwift's custom data fields are maintained
- ✅ Original files are never modified (creates new files with `_edge840` suffix)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Maven (for building from source)

### Build the project:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Convert a Zwift FIT file:
```bash
java -jar target/zwift-to-garmin-converter.jar "My Zwift Ride.fit"
```

**Output:** Creates `My Zwift Ride_edge840.fit` that you can upload to Garmin Connect.

## 📖 Detailed Usage

### Command Line Interface
```bash
java -jar zwift-to-garmin-converter.jar <input-fit-file>
```

### Examples:
```bash
# Convert a single Zwift activity
java -jar zwift-to-garmin-converter.jar "Zwift - Race on London.fit"

# Convert using Maven (development)
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.MainKt" -Dexec.args="input.fit"
```

## 🔧 How It Works

The tool uses the official Garmin FIT SDK to:

1. **Stream-process** FIT files to preserve message chronological order
2. **Modify only device metadata** - changes manufacturer to "Garmin" and product to "Edge 840"
3. **Remove computed fields** that get regenerated anyway (this reduces file size slightly)
4. **Preserve all activity data** including Zwift's custom developer fields

The resulting file is functionally identical to your original ride, just tagged as coming from a Garmin device.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### File Size Changes
The converted files are typically **25-75% smaller** than originals. This is **normal and expected** because:
- Computed/expanded fields are removed (they get regenerated by Garmin Connect)
- More efficient binary encoding is used
- **All actual ride data is preserved**

### Legal & Ethical Considerations
- This tool modifies metadata only, not actual performance data
- Use responsibly and in accordance with Garmin Connect terms of service
- The goal is to get credit for rides you actually completed, not to fake activities
